## Task 1: Working on the master branch
In task 1, both userA and userB are working on the master branch (modify and push to master). At this point, there is no particular error/conflict because userA and userB made changes to the local repository after pulling the changes from master first, keeping the file constant and up-to-date on both users' directory.

## Task 2: Resolving Conflicts
We got the error message saying "failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/lingjieqiao/stat159-2016fall-lab5.git'." With hint saying "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally", we should pull the changes from master first and make our own changes to the document. This will avoid the problem of having inconsistent materials between local and remote.

## Task 3: Working on multiple branches
We got a git notification saying "auto-merging failed - merge conflict." At this point, we should manually merge the two files in order to avoid conflict.
